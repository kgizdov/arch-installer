# arch-installer
WIP: An installer for Arch Linux

In the future this will potentially house and awesome interactive installer for Arch Linux. For the moment it doesn't do anything.

### Needed

 - an awesome name (See [#1](/../../issues/1))
 - decide on a framework/language to use (See [#2](/../../issues/2))
 - decide on requirements (See [#3](/../../issues/3))
 - make it work
